# Aerial
Aerial is my first Deep Learning project. It predicts the environment of an image.  
As it is my first Deep Learning project, I apologize for the mistakes I have probably made.<br/>
Doing this project taught me the basics of the structure of a convolution network, its learning and programming.<br/>
I have taken inspiration from various sources mentioned on my website.<br/>
Finally, I obtained good results with this convolution network as shown in the following confusion matrix.<br/>
